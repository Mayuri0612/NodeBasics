# NodeBasics

This is a repository which contains code covering the basics of Node.js.

##One of the important feature of Nodejs is callbacks.

Callback is an asynchronous equivalent for a function. 

A callback function is called at the completion of a given task. 

Node makes heavy use of callbacks. 

All the APIs of Node are written in such a way that they support callbacks.
